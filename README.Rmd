<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of WaterOfIndia is to list all Inland water bodies in India and calculate the area covered by them. There is also an intention to check the seasonality of the water bodies i.e. the change in area based on season/time of a year.
This project is designed to support [Centre for Aquatic Livelihood Jaljeevika](https://www.jaljeevika.org/), a social initiative by [Ashoka Fellow](https://www.ashoka.org/en-us/ashoka-fellows) [Neelkanth Mishra](https://www.ashoka.org/en/fellow/neelkanth-mishra).
